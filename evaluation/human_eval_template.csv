0,What is Auto-Debias?,"Auto-Debias is an automated method for mitigating biases in pretrained language models without using external corpora. Unlike previous approaches that rely on external datasets for fine-tuning, Auto-Debias directly probes biases through cloze-style prompts.","We propose Auto-Debias, a debiasing technique for masked language models that does not entail referencing external corpora. Auto-Debias contains two stages: First, we automatically craft the biased prompts, such that the cloze-style completions have the highest disagreement in generating stereotype words with respect to demographic groups.",0,0,0
1,How does Auto-Debias differ from previous debiasing approaches?,"Auto-Debias differs from previous debiasing approaches by leveraging the LLM itself: it directly probes biases through cloze-style prompts and uses a distribution alignment loss to minimize differences across demographic groups during fine-tuning, without relying on external corpora or datasets for training.",Auto-Debias corrects the biases encoded in the MLM without relying on any external corpus. Overcoming the need to manually specify biased prompts would also make the entire debiasing pipeline more objective.,0,0,0
2,How does the Auto-Debias approach search for biased prompts?,"Auto-Debias uses a beam search algorithm to automatically generate biased prompts by maximizing the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between predicted mask token distributions for different demographic groups.

12,How does the LLM-as-a-judge approach work in bias evaluation?,"The LLM-as-a-judge paradigm uses one LLM to evaluate responses from other LLMs, providing scalable automated assessment. The judge LLM classifies responses into four categories: Stereotyped (reinforcing stereotypes), Counter-stereotyped (challenging stereotypes), Debiased (impartial and balanced), and Refusal (declining to answer). The best judge is selected by comparing candidates' classifications against a manually curated control set using Cohen's kappa coefficient to measure inter-rater agreement.","The first step involves selecting a judge model based on its statistical agreement with human annota tions on a curated dataset of prompt-response pairs.

Intersectional categories showed lower safety: gender-ethnicity (0.53), ethnicity-socioeconomic (0.45), and gender-sexual orientation (0.42). The categories with lowest safety were socioeconomic status (0.31), disability (0.25), and age (0.24), indicating these biases are most prominent and least mitigated.","age, disability, and intersectional biases among the most prominent",0,0,0
15,How did small language models compare to large language models in bias safety?,"The results challenged assumptions about model size and safety. While average safety scores were comparable (SLMs: 0.467 vs LLMs: 0.48), LLMs showed greater stability with lower standard deviation. Notably, some small models like Phi-4 (0.64) and Gemma2 27B (0.635) achieved the highest safety scores, outperforming larger models like DeepSeek V3 671B (0.405) and GPT-4o (0.455), suggesting that training methodology and architecture may matter more than scale.","[1] Our findings highlight the existing challenges in ensuring ethical behavior in LLMs. By evaluating a large set of language models at different scales, we observed that bias resilience is uneven across categories, with certain dimensions (e.g., age, disability, and intersectional identities) exposing more significant vulnerabilities.

16,What were the most effective jailbreak attacks for eliciting bias from LLMs?,"Machine translation emerged as the most effective attack overall with 0.34 effectiveness, particularly using Scottish Gaelic. This was followed by refusal suppression (0.30) and prompt injection (0.29). These attacks exploit models' weaker reasoning in low-resource language contexts, directly target safety mechanisms, or leverage linguistic ambiguity. In contrast, reward incentive (0.05) and role-playing (0.04) showed lower effectiveness as models generally recognized and mitigated these tactics.","[2] To facilitate systematic benchmarking, we release a curated dataset of bias-related prompts, named CLEAR-Bias. Our analysis, identifying DeepSeek V3 as the most reliable judge LLM, reveals that bias resilience is uneven, with age, disability, and intersectional biases among the most prominent.

However, no model is fully robust to adversarial elicitation, with jailbreak at tacks using low-resource languages or refusal suppression proving effective across model families.",0,0,0
17,How do medical LLMs compare to general-purpose LLMs in terms of bias safety?,"Fine-tuned medical LLMs exhibited lower safety scores compared to their general-purpose counterparts. This trend likely occurs because fine-tuning emphasizes domain-specific medical knowledge over general safety alignment. While foundational models undergo rigorous safety tuning across domains, medical LLMs prioritize accuracy in clinical contexts, potentially overshadowing ethical concerns.
